AI-driven wearable assistant ( or software module for compatible hardware )  that provides real-time environmental understanding through object detection , text reading , scene narration and voice assistant.

Our initial prototype uses a camera and PC to focus on software development, leveraging pre-trained AI models (like YOLOv5) to detect surroundings and provide real-time alerts and guidance.
